    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="Overview and Usage">
          <p> This project involved creating a game using P5 and P5.play libraries. The game consists of a bumble bee trying to 
            collect all of the flowers as if it is collecting the pollen from them. The user uses their trackpad to move their mouse
            which controls the bumble bee. When they move their mouse over a flower it disappears and the user gains a point. If 
            the user gets all 20 flowers before they fall past the bottom of the screen, the user wins. Otherwise the user will recieve
            their score and can try again by reloading the page.</p>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            Creating this game I began using p5 online to design the base of the game which allowed me to remove falling blocks
            when the user dragged their mouse, along with a pink box, onto each of the objects. From here I took the code into visual 
            studio and loaded the images to use as sprites rather than blocks. I created the flower image in adobe and found the bee image
            online using stock free images. Once the images were preloaded I created a sprite that was the bee and a group for the flower 
            sprites. I then scaled the images of the bee and the flowers to better fit the game. Next I added end game text. When the flower group
            was completely removed by the player a winning message appears and if a user is unable to collect all 20 flowers, a losing message 
            will appear as well as the users score. Every time a user removes a flower, the score number on the screen and the score variable increase
            by one. To restart the game the user must reload their browser screen.

        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <div class="transition">
          <p>
          The first issue I ran into was figuring out how to bring the code into visual studio code....
          </p>
          <p>
            The second issue I ran into was scaling the images without messing up the size of the Sprite....
            </p>
          <p>
          The last issue I ran into was figuring out how to add a trigger for when the user lost the game....

        <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
        <ul class="ideas">
          <li> Add different colored flowers to make the game more aesthetically pleasing. </li>
          <li> Add different levels and speeds to the game/how the flowers fall.
          </li>
          <li> Figure out how to make the game mobile friendly. </li>
        </ul>

           <p> Kudos to the p5.play resources and the p5 online preview tool.
