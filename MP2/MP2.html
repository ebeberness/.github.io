    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="Overview and Usage">
          <p> This project invovled creating six images and/or sounds that users could interact with. The goal was
            to use p5.js techniques to create the sketches. I began by ideating with different design ideas including flowers and smiley faces to inspire
            each of the images. Then I created the sketches on p5.js before copying them to visual studio code. On visual 
            studio code I was able to make adjustments to ensure everything worked properly on a the larger windows. Users
            can interact with the last the second smiley face image by reloading the new page for a new smile, can watch a flower
            bloom and close again by dragging their mouse to different parts of the screen, and can play music with the last two images
            but starting and stopping the song with just a click of their mouse. Checkout the gallery on my homepage to interact with each drawing.</p>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            This project invovled creating six images and/or sounds that users could interact with. 
            <li> 
             Static Sketch: A smiley face made up of a circle, rectangels, and an arc. 
            </li>
            
            <li>Random Sketch: A similar smiley face but the mouth changes into a different expression each time
            the page reloads and the mouth is made up of different arc sizes. </li>
            
            <li>Loop Sketch: A flower whose leaves spin continuously. The flower is made up of elipses and the 
            rotation function is used to rotate the petals. The stem is a line, the middle has a circle, and the leaves 
            are also ellipses.</li>
            
            <li>Interactive Sketch: An interactive sketch  of a flower that allows a user to move their mouse to see the flower grow and shrink
            as if it is blooming. The flower is made up of the same properties, ellipses for petals and leaves, cirlce 
            for center of the flower, and line for the stem. MouseX and MouseY were used to create the mouse interaction.</li>
           
            <li>Audio Sketch: The song "Walking on Sunshine" will play when the user clicks on the screen
            and when they click the screen again it will stop. The sound was imported using an MP3 copy of the song. There is an image of a sun made up of the star function 
            and a circle on the screen.  </li>
            
            <li>Audio and Visuals Sketch: A user can make a flower rotate to the song "Walking on Sunshine" by clicking on the pink box in the top left corner of the screen.
              When the music starts the flower spins and to stop the music and flower simultaneously the user can press the pink box again. The user can see they have pressed
              the button because it will turn hot pink when the song is playing and back to light pink when the song is stopped.
              The rotating flower  is made up of the same properties as previous sketches and the sound in an uploaded MP3 audio file.
           </li>

        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <div class="transition">
          <p>
          The first issue I ran into was figuring out how to get the flower to rotate. I was confused by how the 
          rotate function could be used but after looking at more examples on p5.js and watching videos that were
          linked in the project description I was able to solve the issue. I learned how I was supposed to use push() 
          and pop() and where in the sequence rotate() should be placed.
          </p>
          <p>
          The second issue I ran into was using the sound in my last two images. This was an easier fix as I realized on 
          my walk home from class that I had simply routed to the song incorrectly and used the wrong path. Instead of 
          saying /MP2/sunshine.mp3 I had left it at /sunshine.mp3.
          </p>
          <p> The last issue I ran into was fitting the images of each of my sketches into the containers on the gallery page.
            Since I used windowHeight and windowWidth to adjust the eyes for my smiley face sketches, they became distorted when trying
            to use iFrame. I deteremined it was better to use images and gifs after spending time trying to alter the sketches.
          </p>

        <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
        <ul class="ideas">
          <li> Make the images of the flowers into full scenes including clouds and sunshines. </li>
          <li> Figuring out how to spin the flower at the exact tempo of the music. </li>
          <li> Making the smiley face into an image that could be translated together and appear on 
            different parts of the screen.
          </li>
          <li> Ensure all of the images are more mobile friendly. </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Kudos</h2>
        <div class = "kudos">
           <p> The resources I used for this project included the entire p5.js references section and videos from 
            coding train about mouseX and mouseY, rotating images, and randomizing different aspects of an image. 
          
          Kudos to Prerna for helping me download "Walking on Sunshine" in an mp3 format.</p>
