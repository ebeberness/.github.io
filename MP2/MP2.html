    <h2>Overview</h2>
        <div class="Overview and Usage">
          <p> This project invovled creating six images and/or sounds that users could interact with. The goal was
            to use p5.js techniques to create the sketches. I began by sketching flowers and smiley faces to inspire
            each of the images. Then I created the sketches on p5.js before copying them to visual studio code. On visual 
            studio code I was able to make adjustments to ensure everything worked properly on a the larger windows. Users
            can interact with the last the second smiley face image by reloading the new page for a new smile, can watch a flower
            bloom and close again by dragging their mouse to different parts of the screen, and can play music with the last two images
            but starting and stopping the song with just a click of their mouse.</p>

        <h2>Development Process</h2>
        <div class="issue">
          <p>
            This project invovled creating six images and/or sounds that users could interact with. 
            The first is an image of a smiley face made up of a circle, rectangels, and an arc. 
            The second is an image of a similar smiley face but the mouth changes into a different expression each time
            the page reloads and the mouth is made up of different arc sizes. 
            The third is a flower whose leaves spin continuously. The flower is made up of elipses and the 
            rotation function is used to rotate the petals. The stem is a line, the middle has a circle, and the leaves 
            are also ellipses.
            The fourth image is interactive and allows a user to move their mouse to see the flower grow and shrink
            as if it is blooming. The flower is made up of the same properties, ellipses for petals and leaves, cirlce 
            for center of the flower, and line for the stem. MouseX and MouseY were used to create the mouse interaction.
            The fifth is an interactive sound. The song "Walking on Sunshine" will play when the user clicks on the screen
            and when they click the screen again it will stop. There is an image of a sun made up of the star function 
            and a circle on the screen. The sound was imported using an MP3 copy of the song. 
            The last image is the rotating flower made up of the same properties as before, but this time when the user 
            clicks the screen the MP3 of "Walking on Sunshine" will play and the petals will spin. When the user clicks
            the screen again and the music stops the petals also stop spinning.   </p>

        <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
        <div class="transition">
          <p>
          The first issue I ran into was figuring out how to get the flower to rotate. I was confused by how the 
          rotate function could be used but after looking at more examples on p5.js and watching videos that were
          linked in the project description I was able to solve the issue. I learned how I was supposed to use push() 
          and pop() and where in the sequence rotate() should be placed.
          </p>
          <p>
          The second issue I ran into was using the sound in my last two images. This was an easier fix as I realized on 
          my walk home from class that I had simply routed to the song incorrectly and used the wrong path. Instead of 
          sayinh /MP2/sunshine.mp3 I had left it at /sunshine.mp3.
          </p>

        <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
        <ul class="ideas">
          <li> Make the images of the flowers into full scenes including clouds and sunshines. </li>
          <li> Figuring out how to spin the flower at the exact tempo of the music. </li>
          <li> Making the smiley face into an image that could be translated together and appear on 
            different parts of the screen.
          </li>
          <li> Ensure all of the images are more mobile friendly. </li>
        </ul>
  
        <h2>Kudos</h2>
        <div class = "kudos">
           <p> The resources I used for this project included the entire p5.js references section and videos from 
            coding train about mouseX and mouseY, rotating images, and randomizing different aspects of an image. 
          
          Kudos to Prerna for helping me download "Walking on Sunshine" in an mp3 format.</p>
