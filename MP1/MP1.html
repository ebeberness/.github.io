      <div class="Overview and Usage">
        <p> This pop-up extension allows users to keep track of their water intake throughout
        the day. This was inspired by my personal terrible habit of never drinking water. 
        The hope is that by checking off the boxes, working towards a specific goal of 60oz
        of water a day, and playing with a fun rotating image, myself and others will be 
        more motivated to drink water. To use the pop-up click on the smiling water cup icon 
        and proceed by checking the boxes for the number of ounces of water you have had that day
        or use the "clear" button to clear the checkboxes and restart. A link to add the extension 
        to your browser will be added shortly as it is currently under review by Chrome Extensions.
        To view the code used for the extension visit the github repository: https://github.com/ebeberness/funExtension </p>

      <h2>Development Process</h2>
      <div class="issue">
        <p>
      For this pop-up I began by creating the pop-up box with the heading and other text regarding
      the water goals. I then added the check boxes, originally to the right of the text, and then 
      moved to them to the left of the text they correlated with. The text for each text box was 
      organized by a different number of ounces so the user could see the accumulation of ounces. 
      The ounces accumulate in 12oz segments. I 
      also added a fun water image to the pop-up to make it a more fun interaction. This image was 
      designed to spin if a user hovers over it. The image was also used for the icon associated with 
      the extension. Lastly, I added a button that allowed users to clear all of the check boxes if they 
      wanted to restart or completed their goal once already that day, and just wanted a quicker way to 
      uncheck the boxes.  </p>

      <h2>Issue Deep-Dive</h2>
      <div class="transition">
        <p>
        The first issue I ran into was getting the image to spin when a user hovered over it. I looked
        up solutions on the internet but could not get the image to react. I tried using the cheatsheet 
        code I had for enlarging images to see if this would be similar. Finally I asked a peer, Mackenzie,
        how she was able to rotate images on her portfolio. I then discovered the issue was that I had not
        defined the class for my image so using .picture would not associate with the image. 
        </p>
        <p>
        The second issue I ran into was clearing all of the checkboxes at once using the clear button. I again
        started by searching for solutions online and found a couple that seemed as if they should have worked
        but after playing with them for an hour I still could not get it to work. I gave up on the button, but 
        decided to ask for help during class which allowed me to discover how to use Nodelists. From here I
        I was able to figure out the solution to unchecking all of the boxes using the "clear" button.
        </p>

      <h2>Ideas and Future Work</h2>
      <ul class="ideas">
        <li> Being able to save which boxes had already been checked after a user click in and out of the pop-up </li>
        <li> Allowing the user to set their goal for how much water they want to drink</li>
        <li> Making it even more aesthetically pleasing and adding more fun images</li>
        <li> Making it mobile friendly and sharing it with friends </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kudos</h2>
      <div class = "kudos">
         <p> My peer Mackenzie assisted with me with adding the rotation transformation on the image displayed on 
          my pop-up becuase she had learned how to do so in her MP0. I also found the class examples with to be useful
          when writing the javascript portion, learning how to create Nodelists, and adding other functions. </p>
