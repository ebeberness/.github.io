      <div class="transition">
        <p>
        For my CSS transition I had the title of my portfolio grow when a user hovers over it. This makes
        the title stand out and makes hovering over the site more fun and interactive. I used the hover and 
        grow commands in conjunction with the header class to make the transition work.

        class = "gif"

        >
      </div>

      <h2>Ideas and Future Work:</h2>
      <ul class="ideas">
        <li> Being able to save which boxes had already been checked after a user click in and out of the pop-up </li>
        <li> Choosing an overall color palette for the entire site </li>
        <li> Adding more advance CSS transitions such as bouncing for fun titles on each page</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Kudos:</h2>
      <div class = "kudos">
         <p> Mackenzie assisted with me with adding the rotation transformation on the image displayed on 
          my pop-up becuase she had learned how to do so in her MP0. </p>
