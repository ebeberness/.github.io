        <h2>About me - Hi! I'm Elliana Beberness</h2>
        <p class="intro-paragraph">
          I am a senior at the University of Washington, majoring in Human-Centered 
          Design and Engineering with a minor in Entreprenuirship. I hope to combine my 
          UX design and research skills with business practices to succesfully make
          useful and intuitive products. As a designer, my goal is to produce products that are user-oriented, and because of this I will have an 
          understanding of the user's perspective. With this perspective and my problem solving 
          skills, I can advise future clients about solutions that are best for themselves and
          for their users. After graduation I will be working as a UX designer
          at Expedia Group and currently work as a Product Marketing Director at a small start
          up company. I hope to learn new skills in HCDE 438 to improve my skills for both of these jobs.
