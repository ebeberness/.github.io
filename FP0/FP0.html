      <h1>FP Proposal</h1>

<p>A one-sentence description of your project</p>

I will create a drawing board using p5 that will allow users to create art using different tools and download the canvas onto their device.

<p>At least two drawing of your envisioned interface</p>

**add images**

<p> Descriptions of two versions of your project:
    Prototype version - A minimal version that demonstrates the core features of your app. This should be functional, but it does not have to be robust or beautiful. For example, some parts might be hardcoded instead of accepting user input, and you might have minimal CSS styling.

    The MVP will allow users to draw basic things with their cursor in black and white. It will also allow the user to change the background to different colors and to 
    download their drawing to their device.

    Final Version - Your envisioned final submission.</p>

    The final version will include allow the user to use their cursor, represented oringinally on the screen as a paintbrush, to draw on the board. They will be able to choose the color 
    they are drawing and draw with circles or squares if the user changes their cursor using buttons on the side of the screen. 

<li>A numbered, step-by-step plan for your development process, with two milestones (the prototype version and final version)</li>

<li>1. Begin by creating the canvas on p5.</li>
<li>2. Research how to add tools such as the sliders to change the background and how to draw using the cursor.</li>
<li>3. Input a slider into the p5 code and set the colors it will change the background to.</li>
<li> Insert code that allows user to draw with what appears as a paintbrush or pen and research how the user would draw with objects such as circles or squares.</li>
<li>7. Figure out the code for saving the canvas and add to p5.</li>
<li>4. Research how to turn cursor into a pen or paintbrush image and insert the code into p5. </li>
<li> MILESTONE 1: MVP complete</li>
<li>5. Determine how to add buttons to the screen that would change the cursor. </li>
<li>6. Add button codes for circle drawing, square drawing, and pain brush drawing adjacent to the slider. </li>
<li>8. Run final tests on code, copy code into visual studio code, push to github.</li>
<li>9. Complete write-up for final project.</li>
<li> MILESTONE 2: Final version complete</li>

<li>A list of known unknowns (things you don't currently know how to do, but know you will have to figure out)</li>

<li>• How to turn the cursor into an image such as a paintbrush.</li>
<li>• The code for allowing a user to freely draw on the canvas with their mouse.</li>
<li>• slider tools for changing the background </li>
<li>• Code to save canvas to the users device </li>
<li>• How to add buttons that will allow the user to change the brush they are drawing with (from pen to cirlce or square)</li>

<li>A list of stretch goals.</li>
<li>• Allowing user to change the color of their pen </li>
<li>• Clear the canvas without having to reload the page </li>
<li>• Allow user to change the thickness of the pen they are drawing with </li>
