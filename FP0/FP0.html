      <h1>FP Proposal</h1>

<h4>Description of Project</h4>

I will create a drawing board using p5 that will allow users to create art using different tools and download the canvas onto their device.

<h4>Drawings of your envisioned interface</h4>

<img class = "picture" src = "/images/MVP.png" alt = "image of final project MVP"/>
<img class = "picture" src = "/images/FinalVersion.png" alt = "image of final project final version" />

<h4> Project Version Descriptions </h4>
   <p>Prototype version:

    The MVP will allow users to draw basic things with their cursor, a paintbrush, in black and white. It will allow the user to change the background to different colors. The canvas will also
    download the drawing to the users device. </p>

    <p>Final Version - Your envisioned final submission:

    The final version will include allow the user to use their cursor, represented oringinally on the screen as a paintbrush, to draw on the specified canvas area of the page. They will be able to choose the color 
    they are drawing and draw with circles or squares if the user changes their cursor using buttons on the side of the screen. There will be a button to download the art on the screen as well.</p>

<h4>Developmental Process</h4>

<ol>1. Begin by creating the canvas on p5.</ol>
<ol>2. Research how to add tools such as the sliders to change the background and how to draw using the cursor.</ol>
<ol>3. Input a slider into the p5 code and set the colors it will change the background to.</ol>
<ol>4. Insert code that allows user to draw with what appears as a paintbrush or pen and research how the user would draw with objects such as circles or squares.</ol>
<ol>5. Figure out the code for saving the canvas and add to p5.</ol>
<ol>6. Research how to turn cursor into a pen or paintbrush image and insert the code into p5. </ol>
<ol>MILESTONE 1: MVP complete</ol>
<ol>9. Determine how to add buttons to the screen that would change the cursor. </ol>
<ol>10. Add button codes for circle drawing, square drawing, and pain brush drawing adjacent to the slider. </ol>
<ol>11. Add button to save/download the canvas.</ol>
<ol>12. Run final tests on code, copy code into visual studio code, push to github.</ol>
<ol>13. Complete write-up for final project.</ol>
<ol>MILESTONE 2: Final version complete</ol>

<h4>A list of known unknowns:</h4>

<li>How to turn the cursor into an image such as a paintbrush.</li>
<li>The code for al lowing a user to freely draw on the canvas with their mouse.</li>
<li>slider tools for changing the background. </li>
<li>Code to save canvas to the users device. </li>
<li>How to add buttons that will allow the user to change the brush they are drawing with (from pen to cirlce or square).</li>

<h4>A list of stretch goals:</h4>
<li>Separating the drawing canvas and the controls on the larger canvas page.</li>
<li>Allowing user to change the color of their pen. </li>
<li>Clear the canvas without having to reload the page. </li>
<li>Allow user to change the thickness of the pen they are drawing with. </li>
