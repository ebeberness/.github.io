      <h1>FP Proposal</h1>

<p>A one-sentence description of your project</p>

I will update my game to produce 5 different levels of difficulty and display the user's level along with their score.

OR

I will create a drawing board using p5 that will allow users to create art and download it onto their device.

<p>At least two drawing of your envisioned interface</p>

<p> Descriptions of two versions of your project:
    Prototype version - A minimal version that demonstrates the core features of your app. This should be functional, but it does not have to be robust or beautiful. For example, some parts might be hardcoded instead of accepting user input, and you might have minimal CSS styling.
    Final Version - Your envisioned final submission.</p>

<li>A numbered, step-by-step plan for your development process, with two milestones (the prototype version and final version)</li>

<li>A list of known unknowns (things you don't currently know how to do, but know you will have to figure out)</li>

<li>A list of stretch goals.</li>
