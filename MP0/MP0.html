        This project began by downloading the example website created for by the instructor. 
        The next step was to manipulate the example to create a bio page. I added information about
        myself and changed the image that was on the home page and on the bio page itself. Next I changed
        the example of the recipe page to be the cheatsheet page. I altered the text to list a cheatsheet and 
        any extra notes that may want to be included in the future. After altering the contents of these
        pages I changed the background color of the home page to a dark blue and the font to a white. I then 
        changed the color of the background of the individual pages to a light blue and maintained the black text.
        I also altered the font family to be more friendly and fun for each of my pages. Finally I explored
        how to make a CSS transition and began by making the header of my portfolio page grow when a user hovered
        over it. I added the code I used for this to the cheatsheet page. Finally I created this MP0 page and began
        adding the content to it. Below is an image of the bio page before styling was added.

      <h2>Issue</h2>
      <div class="issue">
        <p>
        I encontered an issue when trying to use a CSS transition. I looked at many resources online
        but could not find the solution for a long time. I discovered that I had attempted to use h1 in my css file
        rather than the class name "header" to use the commands grow and hover. I tried multiple types of code before 
        finally discovering it was not overly complicated but I needed a better understanding of what the code was actual
        doing and how it should be formatted in the css file.

      <h2>CSS transition</h2>
      <div class="transition">
        <p>
        For my CSS transition I had the title of my portfolio grow when a user hovers over it. This makes
        the title stand out and makes hovering over the site more fun and interactive. I used the hover and 
        grow commands in conjunction with the header class to make the transition work.

        class = "gif"
        src = "/images/hover_affect_AdobeExpress.gif"
        alt = "gif of animation of the title on portfolio page"
        >

      <h2>Ideas and future</h2>
      <ul class="ideas">
        <li> Changing the images to display context info when a user hovers over them </li>
        <li> Choosing an overall color palette for the entire site </li>
        <li> Adding more advance CSS transitions such as bouncing for fun titles on each page</li>
      </ul>
